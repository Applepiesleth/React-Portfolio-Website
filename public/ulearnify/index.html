            uLearnify is an Online Remedial Literacy Tutorial Program that will allow teachers to create assessments, 
            enter students answers, and track other aspects of their performace such as behavioural indicators. 
            Teachers can then associate test answers and other indicators with skills. <br><br>

            This project was completed through the CMPUT 401 course at the University of Alberta, Fall 2022 semester.

          On this project, I primarily worked as a front-end developer. I worked on creating the different screens on the webapp,
          connecting the database to the front-end, and creating an easy-to-use user interface. I took an extra effort to ensure
          that the app was visually appealing and clean.
          <br><br>
          This was my first time using Typescript, so I had to get used to using types as compared to the chaos of JavaScript. I have
          used React before (like on this website!), but this was my first time using it to interface to a backend.
          <br><br>
          Project management and software design were important aspects during the development of this project. The use of wireframes and
          other prototyping strategies were essential in creating an easy-to-use UI. Accessibility and ease of use were very important to
          our client, so I made sure to keep design principles and Nielson's heuristics in mind. <br><br>

          Here is the original wireframe I created for the project, made using balsamiq:
