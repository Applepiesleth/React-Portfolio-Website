          For Outback Outrun, I wanted to create a simple but polished game that utilized 3D. As I developed this project solo, I had to create all the 
          code and art assets myself. However, I did get help from my brother as he composed the music for the game.
          <br><br>
          Athough the game is in 3D, all the assets are 2D sprites, as I did not have 3D modeling expertise,
          creating a style similar to that of the "Paper Mario" series. As the game involves a lot of dodging, this can make the game difficult as depth
          perception plays a big role in the game. So, it was necessary to give the player and enemies drop shadows to better show depth in the game.
          <br><br>
          I am pretty happy with the results of the game, especially the aesthetics and the camera movement! I hope to play around with 3D more in the future.
