          For Bite-Sized Dungeons, I really wanted to try implementing a form of PCG (procedurally generated content) into my game jam game.
          I decided to go with a dungeon crawler, in which the player can collect upgrades that allows them to access more rooms. In generating
          the dungeon layouts, I needed to make sure that the all layouts are completeable and that all upgrades were necessary to be collected.
          <br><br>
          While the layout of the dungeon is completely procedurally generated, the contents of each room will depend on the type of room it is,
          and a layout is selected from a handful of variants. 
        </div>

        <h2>Dungeon Generation</h2>
        <div class="detailstext">
          Throughout the game, the player will find 3 upgrades in the dungeon: a sharpener that lets your sword break boxes, boots
          that lets you walk on spikes, and a watch that stops enemies briefly. Using these upgrades, the player can access new areas
          that cannot be accessed without it. For example, a corridor may be covered with spikes, requiring the boots to cross it. We'll
          call such corridors "barricades". The dungeon layout must be designed such that all the upgrades must be obtained, and that the upgrade progression is always
          possible (i.e., an upgrade is never placed behind its respective barricade).
          <br><br>
          The algorithm for generating the dungeon is relatively simple. It uses a 2D array of the <code>Room</code> class to store the layout of
          the dungeon. This array is called <code>Map</code>.
          <br><br>
        </div>
        <pre class="codeblock">
public class Room {
  int level;                // Room's place in dungeon progress
  bool[] doors;             // Directions in which doors are found in the room
  int barricadeDirection;   // Direction of barricaded door in room if any, else -1
  int layout;               // Randomized value determining what the room will look like

  List &lt;Entity&gt; enemies;    // Entity struct stores x and y position, and type
  List &lt;Entity&gt; things;

  ...
}

public Room[,] map;         // Map width and height can be changed</pre>
        <div class="detailstext">
          To ensure that dungeon progression is always possible, a random path is created in <code>Map</code> from a start position
          to the location of an upgrade. Once the rooms have been created, a barricade is then placed in a regular room (not the start position or the upgrade room)
          This room will then become the start position for a path leading to the next upgrade, and repeat. This algorithm prevents upgrades
          being locked behind their respective barricade.
        </div>

        <div class="detailstext">
          The <code>level</code> variable in the <code>Room</code> class helps with this generation. A number is associated with certain
          progress checkpoints:
          <br>
          <br>0 - Empty room (not part of the dungeon)
          <br>1 - Starting room
          <br>2 - Room in path to Upgrade 1
          <br>3 - Room containing Upgrade 1
          <br>4 - Room containing Upgrade 1 barricade (starting point for 2nd path)
          <br>5 - Room in path to Upgrade 2
          <br>6 - Room containing Upgrade 2
          <br>7 - Room containing Upgrade 2 barricade (starting point for 3rd path)
          <br>8 - Room in path to Upgrade 3
          <br>...
          <br><br>
          In generating the paths, this level variable is changed in the respective <code>Room</code> in <code>Map</code>.
          Also, barricades can only be generated in rooms with level = 2, 5, 8... or <code>level % 3 == 2</code>. The room must
          also have at least 1 empty room adjacent to it.
          <br><br>
          In adding the next room in a path, the algorithm randomly chooses a direction with an empty room to expand to.
          If no direction is empty, path generation is ended early and the room is turned into an upgrade room. One flaw of this
          algorithm is the chance for a path to be very short because of this.
